                        <p class="wiki-text"> Like in Dusttale, he remembers the human's genocidal routes and does the same things as in Dusttale: he faces and kills the human, absorbing their soul. He commits his own genocidal route on the surface. The amount of hatred and determination that Murdervese had was overwhelming, and to avoid dying, he let Hatred and Determination modify his body. The red part is Determination, while the black part is Hatred, and his purple-pink aura is Perseverance. He no longer feels anything besides this and the desire for destruction for power.</p>
