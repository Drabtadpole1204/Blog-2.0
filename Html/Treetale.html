                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">My first Undertale AU. Treetale. Fun fact: This Sans is the first character I created for this AU. Fun fact 2: His drawing looks bad because I made it on Photopea, I don't know how to use it THAT well. On paper, his head has a shape that resembles a circle stretched sideways, he has a smile and bigger eyes, he is a Skeleton Axolotl. I specifically chose this because Axolotls are known for their healing factor, and the fandom says Sans has 1 HP, but I'm not sure. Treetale is Undertale but the Monsters ressembles more like animals than in the actual game,some didnt change,though.</p>

                        <h3>AU (Alternate Universe)</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">He belongs to Treetale, is kind of lazy, has a brother and a father, lives in Snowdin with them, there's not much else to say.  
                        In this AU, the three main Undertale routes still exist: Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide.
                        <li><strong>Fun Fact:There is a Sansolotl 404, he is from one of Treetale's timelines, from a genocide run.</strong></li>
