                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Brandon is the most powerful infected enemy in Piggy Distortion — an entity spreading infection and causing chaos across the multiverse. Under the command of T.I.O.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article id="tab-abilities" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-btn-abilities" hidden>
                        <h3>Abilities</h3>
                        <ul class="ability-list">
                            <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> Immune to any type of magical attacks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Super-Strength:</strong> Although self-explanatory, his super strength is a bit different. One example of this is that he lifted Cosmo's fist, a deity whose fist is a little larger than half of the Earth, and he has already been able to reset the multiverse with his fists, and lifted an island with his right hand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interfictional Travel:</strong> He can travel to different fictions, like when he went to Undertale and corrupted Frisk and their saves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Super-Speed:</strong> It has reached 50% of the speed of light once, and it has reached the cosmic horizon of the Multiverse#121 (Multiverse where Piggy Distortion is), when it was chasing someone, who was VERY fast, not the Flash,though.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manipulation:</strong> It can create illusions and hallucinations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Insolence:</strong> Like the other Infected Overlords from my universe, he can transform his body into a black liquid called Insolence.
                            <li><strong>Blood Manipulation:</strong> Self-explanatory, it just doesn't work on those who are immune.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weakness:</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Sealing Magic:</strong> The only magical attack to which he is not immune, although the sealing is temporary, it might be enough, or maybe not... constantly using this magic/spamming it will make the sealing time shorter because he will develop immunity to it.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <article id="tab-au" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-btn-au" hidden>
                        <h3>AU</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">A curious fact is that he has another form, called Absolute Brandon, or Brandon Absoluto in Portuguese. Another interesting fact is that Absolute Brandon is Nigh-Omniperfect.</p>
