                        <p class="wiki-text">He was created in the image of SMG4, yet ,no one liked him because he was like a SMG4 copycat, he tried to make friends and was once one of the nicest Memes there was, but anger and hate towards SMG4 took over him,and he desires to get rid of SMG4 so the Meme Cycle is disrupted and the Internet Graveyard will enter in chaos, and the surface too, so SMX can step in and replace SMG4. Their relation is like Metal Sonic with Sonic. He developed hatred and anger towards the SMG4 crew and SMG1 and SMG2, for them have always been disrupting SMX's plan and helping SMG4, he wants to get rid of all of them too, so they aren't a headache anymore.</p>

                        <ul class="ability-list">
                            <li><strong>Copycat:</strong> Can copy anyone's habilities as long as they are on his level of power or lower.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anti-Memer:</strong> Can create anti-memes, the quantity depends on his energy, and he can manipulate the Anti-Meme energy.</li>
                            <li><strong>___________:</strong> Like SMG4, SMG3 and Mario, SMX can also ____________.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anti-energy:</strong> This is kind of a passive hability, but SMX can't be transmuted like other memes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Passive:</strong> This is also a passive hability, SMX has the abilities from Mario and SMG4 too, being made in the image of SMG4, and Mario being SMG4's avatar.</li>
