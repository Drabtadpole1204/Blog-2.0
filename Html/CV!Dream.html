						<h3>Story</h3>
						<p class="wiki-text">Dream from Creatorverse, from my AU based on Dreamtale, Dream is the concept of positivity and the god of positivity, as well as the guardian of the concept. He is the twin brother of CV!Nightmare, and although they are opposites, they get along most of the time. Dream is a calm and kind character, but he knows how to be serious when necessary. He is also very protective of those he loves. An interesting fact is that he is afraid of owls and lightning. Another curiosity is that he looks like a glitch due to having spent a long time in the Anti-Void at some point.</p>

						<h3>Abilities</h3>
						<ul class="ability-list">
							<li><strong>Positivity Aura:</strong> Strengthens allies and calms the environment.</li>
							<li><strong>Light Manipulation:</strong> Can manipulate light for defense and communication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Light Influence:</strong> Can shape positivity to help and monitor spaces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Positivity Arrow:</strong> Thus, like the original, it is a Bow made of Positivity, which shoots Positive Arrows.</li>
							<li><strong>Twin Daggers:</strong> Just like the original, they are daggers made for melee combat; the difference is that these affect people,other villains besides Nightmare.</li>
                            <li><strong>Polar Immortality:</strong> He is immortal; although he can be hurt, he cannot be killed, only by Nightmare. Being polar opposites, Dream's soul cannot be touched by others, it is impossible, except by Nightmare..</li>
						</ul>
