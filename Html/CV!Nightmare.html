                        <h3>AU</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Nightmare from Creatorverse, from my AU based on Dreamtale. Anyway, Nightmare is a character I created based on the Dreamtale Nightmare, but he has some differences, like being yellow, for example. He’s not exactly a villain or a hero, he just acts as he wants, although he is the concept and the god of negativity, as well as the guardian of the concept. He has affection for CV!Dream (Creatorverse Dream), his twin brother. Despite this, he is still a bit chaotic and knows how to be serious when necessary... sometimes too much.</p>
