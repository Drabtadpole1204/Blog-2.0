                        <h3>Story</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">A Living Potion, made by Eliza The Witch, he is under the commands of the Minecraft Deities, he can make the potion's effects from Mincraft, create new effects, and much more. Fun Fact: Once he absorved the powers/effects of the Command Block, he can use those powers such as summoning but he isn't able to use the '/kill' he doesnt 'type' those commands directly, he kind of uses it as a natural power, I'm not sure how to explain this.</p>

                            <li><strong>Summoning:</strong> He can summon any mob, with or no armor, the quantity depends on his stamina/energy</li>

                            <li><strong>Omnipresence:</strong> This is something complex to explain, but long story short, he is present in EVERY Minecraft World which has the Cyber Mod, this causes his power to be divived between himself from other worlds,the one you see is only one of his physical forms, his form is the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Black Hole:</strong> He can create a Blue Black Hole for a couple of seconds.</li>

                            <li><strong>Energy Beam:</strong> It's a beam he launches from his Staff, he does that when he spins it like Baron Von Bats from PVZ GW2, It deals a lot of damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Omega Beam:</strong> It's a beam he launches from his Staff too, that one being Blue on the outside and Black on the inside its very big and deals way more damage than the last one, it can one-shot a normal shield, and destroy a Unbreaking III Shield within 5 seconds. It also causes a Wither effect. </li>

                        <h3>Mod</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Long Ago, before the world we knew as Minecraft was created, there was a deity, whose name was Notch, he created other deities to watch over the world, which was called Minecraft, upon observing the world, seeing the bad and good side, the deities were cruel but not exactly evil.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Notch despised their behavior and expelled them from Minecraft, leaving them on a giant endless white void, years passed on the outside world, but countless eons on the inside world.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">And 'Mods' were created, seeing Notch didnt care about the mods and them and liked them so much he never saw if they brought damage as he never paid attention, those deities, who are 12, had a plan, they hid inside a mod  called Cyber Mod,and went on it,being inserted once again into Minecraft, but this time, they took care of Notch, but they didnt kill him,they took over the ENTIRE Minecraft World, but not as a virus, and no one noticed it.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">They remained observant,they created a a guardian, called the Alpha Warden, the world's 'updates' were ideas of Notch while he was in his deep slumber,kind of sealed away. Alpha Warden is a yellow Warden with wings and with a halo on his head,the Wardens were created after him,kind of made in his image.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">The Cyber mod also included futuristic characteristics. Such as new areas, roboticized mobs of course, robots. A war once happened in the world, and it led to most of humanity being extincted, except for some people.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">In the Mod, there are 2 Paths: the 'Extermination Route', in which ended with the robot kind being extermined and you being almost the last being on Earth. And the 'Reconciliation Route', which ended with peace being restored.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Potionhead is a boss from the Extermination Route, he will try to stop your omnicide at all costs, if defeated, he will realize that world cannot be saved anymore and he wont be present in it anymore. The Protagonist realizes there are deities which each enemy. The Protagonist is almost the last being on Earth, almost, and they will try to destroy every piece of robot-kind,but Potionhead and others will not allow it, with each enemy before and after Potionhead will spill out clues about deities, thinking the Protagonist knows about them,but he does not.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">According to the Book of Ancients, the battle between The Protagonist and Potionhead shook the world. The only reason why it didnt collapse was due to the Alpha Warden, who was able to stabilize it.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">By the way. Minecraft World > Super world > world > Mini-world > Seeds > Overworld, The End, The Nether.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Also, the Overworld, The End, and The Nether are infinitely-sized dimensions. and a seed contains them. There are Countless Super Worlds in the Minecraft World, those containing countless worlds. The worlds contain countless mini-worlds, each mini-world contain a Seed, each seed contains the 3 Minecraft Dimensions.</p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">What contains a seed is usually called world, but here, its called mini-world.</p>
