                        <p class="wiki-text"> Literally the Freddy 64 gang from TPRR,but I made my own version of them,and added a new character,Daemon.
                            Freddy and Friends are a group of characters that are like the ones from the original FNAF, but in the 64 style. I will only talk about Freddy 64 and Daemon in this wiki.</p>

                            <li><strong>Toon Force:</strong> He can summon things out of nowhere like in an RPG, but this ability can only be used to summon weapons he can hold in his hand, and they can't be too big, and it's also normal Toon Force.</li>
                            <li><strong>Platformer Movement:</strong> Technically, this isn't a skill, but rather something passive of his, I just added it here so it wouldn't look too empty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unique Cooking:</strong> Is also kinda of passive, can cook foods that can give magical abilities, for example.</li>
                            <li><strong>Now about his abilities during the time when the Apocalypse happens:</strong> Fun Fact: By Apocalypse, I meant an infection that occurred at some point, I'm not sure if it was worldwide or just where he was, I didn't think about it, but this infection also affected Animatronics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Summon Portals:</strong> He can summon portals to travel through the multiverse of FNAF and TPRR, and Roblox, which is technically a Complex Multiverse, or a Hyperverse, I'm not sure.</li>

                            <li><strong>Redcliff Duality:</strong> Redcliff Sword and Shield, a Roblox clan at war against Korblox, he got this weapon after also ending up in Redcliff by accident. This weapon can summon a spirit, or a stand, from Redcliff.</li>
                            <li><strong>Remington 870:</strong> A Remington 870.</li>
                            <li><strong>Axe:</strong> A common axe.</li>

                            <li><strong>Fly:</strong> Can fly or float.</li>

                             <li><strong>Anti-Visibility:</strong> He can be visible to just one person or anyone he wants, or to no one at all; another name for this ability could be Invisibility.</li>
                             <li><strong>Toon Force:</strong> It's like a toon force, but much weaker.</li>
                            <li><strong>Platformer Movement:</strong> He can do this as normal 64.</li>
                            <li><strong>Although he has control over Body 64, he cannot cook like him, because Body 64's cooking requires unique knowledge. And creativity.</strong> </li>

                        <h3>AU</h3>
                        <p class="wiki-text">There's not much to say at the start, other than Freddy 64 going on crazy adventures in and out of his Pizzeria with his gang, sometimes running into villains like Glitchtrap. </p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Now the Apocalypse he ended up getting into:

                        </p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">
                            Freddy 64 ended up losing one of his eyes, and his torso was damaged by Prowler, and he lost one of his ears due to Infected Twisted Plushtrap. Freddy 64 amputated his ear so that the infection wouldn't spread through his body, without anesthesia, just with his axe (not the Overkill, a normal axe). This happened during the Infection, but before he acquired the weapons he has. He is usually very charismatic, kind, polite, and friendly, but on one occasion he accidentally caused the Third World War, because during the war between Redcliff and Korblox, Korblox or Redcliff (I don't remember) forced 64 and his friends to fight for the clan, and 64 wanted to start a revolution against Korblox/Redcliff, which was a disaster because both clans declared war on the survivors, and the rest of the world followed along with them. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Thanks to the skills and experience of the survivors and some powerful beings on their side, they didnâ€™t fall, but they also didnâ€™t win the war, which almost split the Earth in half, but that did not happen due to the plan that squad 64 developed. An interesting fact is that the Overseers also joined the war against the Survivors. 64 spent a good amount of time separated from their gang during the apocalypse and the war, but fortunately, they reunited during the end of the infection.
                        </p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">Fun Fact:

                            At a certain point during the infection, 64 found a strange yellow crystal in the sea. Little did he know that the crystal trapped a 1-trillion-year-old spirit, which had once been human. He unintentionally freed the being when he touched the crystal. The being entered 64â€”into his mind, that is. At first, he couldnâ€™t let go of the crystal, until he was possessed by the spirit. He was called 'Possessed 64' in this state, or '64 Possessed,' which meant the spirit was in control of 64â€™s body. 64 regained control after some time. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="wiki-text">
                            Initially, his body did not undergo any physical changes, except for his eyes turning completely golden yellow in this state. When he is possessed, his body now changes, but only in color, resembling more of a Golden Freddy, but still 64. The name of this being/spirit is Daemon. When in control of 64, he can do whatever he wants, with consequences like lack of energy and fatigue affecting not him, but 64 when he regains control.

                            Possessed 64 also has a 'Ghost State', in which he becomes translucent and can pass through walls and solid objects, but cannot attack in this state, only pass through solid things.
                        </p>
